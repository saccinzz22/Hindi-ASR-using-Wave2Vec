# Hindi-ASR-using-Wave2Vec2
 

This project fine-tunes the `facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53` model for Hindi speech recognition using the Common Voice dataset.  

## Features  
- Data preprocessing and tokenization  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Word Error Rate (WER) computation  
- Saving and loading trained model weights  

## Usage  
Train the model in Google Colab and download the weights locally after training. The trained model can be used for inference on new audio samples.  

## Model Checkpoint  
After training, the model weights are saved and can be loaded for further fine-tuning or inference.
